# Where's Sausage Dog?

Mathilde Davan

This is a game where you need to find the sausage dog hidden among other animals. It has three levels of difficulty. The number of random animals increases for each level. Once you find the sausage dog, it spins for a bit before the ending screen appears. It is possible to go back to the intro page once reaching the end and trying another level.

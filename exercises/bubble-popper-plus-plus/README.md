# Bubble Popper

Mathilde Davan

This program is a playful code with which the user can interact with by moving their hand. They can create colorful bubbles by closing their hand and pop them by "touching" them with the visual representation of their hand. When a bubble is popped, smaller colorful bubbles appear all over the canvas for a short amount of time like confetti.
Another feature is that when the user putts their hand close to the bubbles without touching them, the bubbles will slowly move away from the hand.
